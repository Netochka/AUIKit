# AUIKit

AUIKit is an advanced extension for UIKit framework. It contains source code, principles and best practices for building efficient, reliable, maintable user interface.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

```ruby
pod 'AUIKit'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is intended to be the simplest way to add frameworks to your Cocoa application.

```
github "ihormyroniuk/AUIKit"
```

## Best Practices

- Build a user interface programmatically in code (don't use [Interface Buider](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/UsingInterfaceBuilder.html))
- Use Frame-Based Layout for building a user interface (don't use [Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853))
